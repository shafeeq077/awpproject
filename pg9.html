    <h1 style="color: brown;text-align: center;">LIFE STAGES</h1>
    <img src="https://7esl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Human-Life-Cycle-1.jpg" width="500px" height="500px">
<p>The stages of human development include the foetus, infancy, toddler years, 
childhood,adolescence, adulthood, oldage </p>
<h2 style="color: black;">THE FOETUS STAGE</h2>
<img src="https://www.naseem.qa/blog/uploads/Fetal-development.jpg" width="500px"height='500px' > 
<p style="color: brown;">The sperm from the adult male human and the egg from the adult female human form a zygote inside the uterus of the female. 
Over time, the zygote develops and forms an embryo. Initially, the embryo looks like a cluster of cells, but after eight weeks, 
the embryo resembles the human body and is called a foetus.
During this stage, the foetus is entirely dependent on the female for breathing, eating and other kinds of resources.</p>
<h2 style="color: black;">THE INFANT STAGE </h2>  
<p style="color: brown;">After around nine months, the foetus is fully developed to be born. This stage in human development marks the period from birth to age one. 
Infancy is the earliest part of childhood, where the infant grows in size and shape. During this stage, infant requires a lot of attention as they are completely dependent on their mothers. 
Infants develop their behaviour, physiology and cognition. Gradually, the infants learn to suck, swallow and cry if they are in an uncomfortable situation.
 Since infants are unable to speak, crying is their way of communicating. The mother tends to breastfeed her infant during this stage.</p>
<h2 style="color: black;">THE TODDLER STAGE </h2>

<p style="color: brown;">The term ‘to toddle’ means to walk unsteadily and the child has a clumsy walk during this period.
     This stage marks the end of early childhood. During this period, the child ages two to three years old. 
     This stage in a child’s life is where they undergo immense cognitive, emotional and social development.</p>
<h2 style="color: black;">THE CHILDHOOD STAGE </h2>

<p style="color:brown;">Here, a child is of age three to six years and is crawling for mobility. In this stage, the child crawls
     and eventually learns to walk, talk, eat independently, and become more aware of their surroundings.
     The child is more social and active during this period and intrigued to learn new things.</p>
<h2 style="color: black;">THE ADOLESCENCE STAGE</h2>

<p style="color: brown;">Here, the child is of age from nine to thirteen years and this period marks the beginning of adolescence.
     In this stage, the child grows into an adolescent, through a period called puberty. Puberty occurs during the initial stages of their
      teenage years, and that’s why adolescents are also called teenagers. In this stage, 
      the teenager grows rapidly and physical changes begin to appear. These changes include hair growth, structural changes in body shape,
       voice cracking in adolescent males, breast growth in adolescent females and so on.
     The behaviour pattern also changes, as they are more independent in performing daily tasks.</p>
<h2 style="color: black;">THE ADULTHOOD STAGE</h2>

<p style="color: brown;">Human beings who are between the age of 20 to 60 years are known as adults. Here, human beings are sexually
     mature and capable of reproducing. The body is fully developed by now, and the adult gains experience and responsibility.
     Adults have full mental and social development by this stage.</p>
<h2 style="color: black;"> THE OLD AGE STAGE </h2>
<img src="https://gumlet.assettype.com/freepressjournal/2022-10/f95af13b-86ec-4069-b6a2-d704030671d1/senior_cit.jpg?w=700&h=400&format=webp" width="500px" height="500px">
<p style="color: brown;"> When an individual reaches 60 or 65 years of age
    , they are called old people. This period starts from 65 years of age, until the end of their lives.
     During this stage, the intestine absorbs fewer nutrients from food sources. The physical capabilities of doing
    tasks are also reduced and they again depend on external support to do things.
    The behaviour of old people in this stage varies, depending on the immunity and lifestyle of the human. 
    The average life expectancy of human beings varies from 70 to 85 years. But this also changes depending on their lifestyle.</p>
<h2 style="color: brown;">CONCLUSION</h2>
<p style="color: black ;font-style: oblique;">A human being’s body undergoes several changes and developments throughout their 
    life span and food acts as the fuel needed for all these changes. Proper nutrition, exercise and a friendly environment ensure
     a healthy human beings in all stages of their life. Some basic nutrients required for human growth are carbohydrates, essential amino acids,
      fatty acids, vitamins and minerals in order to sustain a healthy lifestyle.</p>
